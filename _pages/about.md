I am a final year undergraduate student at UNSW studying a double degree in Actuarial Studies and Mathematics. Having done several internships in different industries, I have found that I am most interested in AI and its ability to create smarter systems. 

I have created this website to document what I have learnt at university, research teams, independent learning and internships.
