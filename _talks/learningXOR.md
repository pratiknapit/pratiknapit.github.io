To make the idea of a feedforward network more concrete, we can use the example of a fully functionaing feedforward network on a very simple task: learning the XOR function. The XOR ("exclusive or") is an operation on 2 binary values, $x_1$ and $x_2$.

When exactly one of these binary values is equal to 1, the XOR function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0. The XOR function provides the target function $ y = f^*(x) $ that we want to learn.
